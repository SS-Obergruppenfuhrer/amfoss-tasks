#TERMINAL WIZARD
This was quite a fun task as i got learn the basic linux commands and how to apply it in the SOLUTION.md file i have showed my history how did i approached the task completely also showing the commands what their function is. It was quite hectic while it was mixed with harry potter thinga because i have never seen it. Finding out answers such as the shapeshifter creature literally boiled my brain. But i had fun doing this task.
for challenge 0 did git clone to bring the neccessary files in my system.
challenge 1 was quite easy just do a simple math problem and navigate to the required dir and file and executed the python file to get code. 
challenge 2 used google to find the qn ans asked then puting the values in x and y got the required code.
challenge 3 the worst mind boiling task for me i was soo pissed that i could not get the spell to destry this creature finally i started to read every spell then i found out and got the secret code.
challenge 4 for this i used git log to find the hiddensecret code as shown in my SOLUTION.md file.
the end then i merged everything in one file and decoded it as it was in base64 ang got the link required.
then as told finally pasted the required ss can be reffered in SOLUTION.md.
