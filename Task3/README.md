#HELLO WORLD!
For this task i had my logic for all languages same that is while the numbers upto our given input have no more than 2 factors it remains true and print the the prime numbers upto that otherwise if it has more than 2 then it gets false skipping into next value. And for the languages i knew some c and python so c++ also i managed others i took help from google and yt for syntax otherwise logic used is same.
