#ADVENTURE IN ATHERIA
first it asks user for the input. Then find minimum times in the list. then counts how many times the minimum time occured if it occurs more than once it prints 'still in atheria', otherwise if once it prints the number of city 

#unveiling the character deviation
MY approach in this task first we ask the user for an input that is the number of times the user gonna give the names. Then with the help of for loop we iterate through each variable and then another for loop nested whhich is checking each char in our variable to the var x which is amdoss that its equal or not if not another variable c adds a value 1 in it denoting the different cahr in our var.

#etherealquest
So in this code first we ask the user to give a input value for the number of times the user is going to input 3 values. Then we initialise a list with values 0 0 0. then in a for loop ask teh user 3 integers then update it to our list after coming out of loop we check if the sum final value in list is 0 0 0 if yes then print yes else no.

#gridlockshowdown
first it takes a value n which is number of est cases. then inside the loop, a 3x3 grid 'l' is initialized as an empty list. another nested loop runs twice, creating a 3x3 grid by taking user input for each row and appending it to the grid. three boolean variables (x_wins, o_wins, and plus_wins) are initialized as False. These variables will be used to keep track of whether 'X' wins, 'O' wins, or if the game is a draw ('+'). The code then checks for winning conditions within the Tic Tac Toe board. It checks for three in a row 'X' or 'O' horizontally and vertically, as well as diagonally. If a winning condition is found, the corresponding boolean variable is set to True and prints that variable won. Or else it prints Draw.

#lostintranslation
in this code we input a word from the user. then we give a variable with name string 'hello'. then in a for loop we iterate through each char from the inut word and comare it with hello string. if the length of the a is equal to the value of  len of hello then the user said hello correct and print yes. else no.
