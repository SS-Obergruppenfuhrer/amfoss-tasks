# INSTALLING LINUX 
For me installing linux was quite challenging as while installing ubuntu we had to shrink space for a new os. For me the space was not shrinking above 1gb so i seeked help from the server mentors and saw youtube tutorials and finally it got fixed. Ubuntu is quite a different experience and im excited to work with it further while im in club. :)
