# SELF INTRO
Ahoy Comrades!
I'm Sunil Swain, currently a first-year student pursuing computer science engineering (CSE). I have an Interest towards coding. I have a plan set before college that i will get into development and open source with my full potential and explore myself and this field. I am currently doing cs50 to get an idea about all the domains.
# INTROSPECTION
# WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
For me its like i have an interest towards coding so i am very eager to learn new skills which will make me push myself to my limits to achieve it. Ans as i mentioned earlier i have a plan set on my mind before coming here or thats why at the first place i chose this college for this club. foss is exactly offering the thing that i want and ill do my best to achieve it and prove it. I had taken cs during my 11 and 12 and during those times even the most fun period for me was computer lab just so that i can go and do what i like. Trust me ive done many research and and just like that i dont say i have a plan. Yes i have a plan but to execute it properly i think foss is the only place that i can get into. 
# WHATS YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
My plan is to get better in coding and problem solving thinking. The procedure that how to approach and solve a problem. Getting my hands a bit dirty by knowing about development and open source (idk anything yet about these just know). Preparing myself to be able to present and tell someone how am i approaching a problem in english fluently like atleast proper english communication to convey my problem solving procedure.
# HOW WOULD I CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will contribute whatever to the full potential i can. I can share whatever i know and can be helpful to someone in their projects/work, become a helping guide for my collegues and try to interactive as much as possible.
# DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
